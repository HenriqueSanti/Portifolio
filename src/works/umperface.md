## About the project

Umperface is a platform focused on publishing UX design and brand design studies. The goal is to publish studies on several brands seeking to understand their strategies to the maximum, thereby inspiring designers and marketing professionals.
<br>
<br>
The platform exists to help, educate and inspire designers, marketing professionals, and also startups and entrepreneurs to create experiences that tell their stories.


## Brand ID

The brand aims to be extremely optimistic and believe in people. To convey this it was necessary a visual identity that was receptive to everyone who wants to surrender or raise their value through design.

<br>

### Color

Following my creative process, the first step was to define the color palette to be used throughout the project. Because it is a modern and inclusive brand the choice of colors also needed to be diversified but going against the technology scenario, the colors of Umpreface have more pasteurized shades aimed at the visitor's visual comfort.

<br>

### Logo

As said before, the brand intends to be receptive and optimistic, and nothing better than a smile to convey these emotions, so for the logo, I decided to create something that could represent a smile and at the same time match the letter "U" which is the initial of the brand name.

<br>

The first designs seemed much more serious than the brand's proposal, so I went for another venture but with the idea of a mascot logo.

<br>

For typography, in the case of the specific logo, the font chosen was IBM Plex Sans, a pixelated font to reinforce the idea of a product for designers.

<br>

## Mascot

<br>

The Umper tends to be the differential of the brand. An alien mascot inspired by the crypto world but reminiscent of a tv animation. Thanks to <a href="https://spline.design/" target="blank">Spline</a> It can appear in 2 or 3 dimensions.

<br>

### Typography

In the typography to be used on the website, I chose to use two fonts, for the headers I chose Space Grotesk because it is a modern font and at the same time pixelated which once again brings the idea of a product for designers but also resembles in style and history with the mascot Umper.

For the body text, I chose Inter, which is simple, elegant, and modern, as well as matching almost any other sans serif font.

## Web design aplication

Considering that the target audience spends most of their time in front of the screens, and aiming not to harm the eyes of the visitors, even more, the dark mode gained priority in this project.

As it is an MVP, the intention was to create a simple and friendly interface with only the main features of the application, but at the same time convey the brand's message.
