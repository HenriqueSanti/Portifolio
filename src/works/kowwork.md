## About the project

Daniel 1:8 is an online community of young Christians focused on youth recovery and friendship.

<br>

In the modern world there is a great harm caused by the excessive use of social networks, diseases such as depression and anxiety have reached more and more young people around the world.

<br>

Daniel 1:8 works by hosting events, sharing Christian motivational content and Bible studies, aiming to reach the maximum number of young people.


## Brand ID

The name of the brand is based on a biblical passage, where the young prophet Daniel rejects the banquets of the king of Babylon because they were full of sacrifices and lust and did not come from his God.

<br>

Daniel 1:8 is a strong, optimistic and receptive brand aimed at young people. For this, a visual identity was needed that was receptive to everyone and demonstrated the strength of youth.

For this young network to show confidence to people, I decided to activate the mage aspect with a diverse color palette and forming gradients. The colors were inspired by the colors of the sky.
