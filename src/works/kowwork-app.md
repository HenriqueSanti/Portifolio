## About the project

Self-taught developers face a problem every day, the difficulty of networking and getting feedback on their projects.

<br>

While those studying at universities not only have the possibility to study in groups and make connections but can also receive feedback from more experienced professors and professionals, self-taught professionals often study alone and do not have access to the same opportunities as those who study at universities.

<br>

kowwork is an open source project that aims to connect self-taught professionals and give them the experience of working remotely as a team, working on more open source projects and contributing to communities.

<br>

The project is being developed in partnership with 3 other developers,
